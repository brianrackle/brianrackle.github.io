Let me get this out of the way, I recommend this book. I don't have a rating system but will go ahead and rate it a seven fruit doves out of nine fruit doves.

[![Effective Modern C++](/assets/emc_fruit_dove.png "Fruit Dove")](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033707.do "O'Reilly")

Scott Meyers, the author of ["Effective Modern C++"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033707.do), is one of the foremost experts on the C++ programming language. In his latest book, he follows the format of his previous "Effective ..." books. This is not a book that should be used to learn C++. In fact, it would be impossible to learn C++ with this book because it only covers a small but specific subset of the C++ programming language. Rather, "Effective Modern C++" gives you the details about how to use the features of C++11/14 to improve your code. Scott Meyers covers details of the language that are not covered anywhere else. And boy does he cover them. Want to know every reason why scoped enums are "preferable" to unscoped enums? Scott Meyers has you covered, chapter 3 item 11, with seven detail filled pages about any circumstance you could encounter while using scoped enums. This book covers details that you could only get from a true master of the language and for that reason I fully recommend it. Here is the current table of contents, so you know what you are getting into before buying:
