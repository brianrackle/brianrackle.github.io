A huge thanks to [Veronica Beley](http://www.veronicabeley.ca) for designing an amazing logo for this site! She took my design requirements and created something super original and amazing! 

## The Design

I was overjoyed when I saw the designs. Please check her [work](http://www.veronicabeley.ca/portfolio.html) out. Don't be hesitant to hire her for your design projects!

Timing in C++ can be tedious. There are so many different ways to accomplish stop-watch functionality, all of which involve C functions. Thankfully, C++11 introduces a brand new header that makes it easy to time things accurately with very little code. C++11 once again saves the world from unclear C-style code, and provides a great specification for handling time in many different ways.

The old C-style way of timing something:

{% highlight c++ %}
clock_t begin = clock();
// task goes here...
double duration = (double)(clock - begin) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
{% endhighlight %}

The code isn't hard, but it does lack clarity. Thankfully, C++11 introduces a better way to manage date and time with the `<chrono>` header. `<chrono>` is best understood by starting with the building block of measuring time, the clock. And amazingly we are given more than a single choice of clocks. The following clocks are available in `<chono>`:
